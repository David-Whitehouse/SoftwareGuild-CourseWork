# SoftwareGuild-CourseWork

The coursework included two mastery projects. One at the middle of the course and one at the end. The first one, FlooringMastery
was used to show competency of the concepts in the first half of the course, which included only back-end development. The Second mastery
project, SuperTracking, is a SuperHero Sightings website. It required both back-end and front-end work to complete it.
